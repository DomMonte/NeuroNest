Welcome to Neuronest Psychology. 
At Neuronest Psychology, we believe every child has the potential to succeed when the right supports are in place. Our role is to uncover how each child learns, thinks, and engages with the world through a range of comprehensive assessments.
We specialise in cognitive, psycho-educational, ADHD, and giftedness assessments. These assessments provide a clear understanding of your child’s strengths, challenges, and learning style. By combining detailed testing with input from families, schools, and (where appropriate) classroom observations, we create a complete picture of your child’s unique learning profile.
With this knowledge, we provide families and educators with practical, evidence-based recommendations to guide tailored support. This ensures your child is not only better understood but also better equipped to reach their full potential and thrive at school, at home, and beyond.


What is a Psycho-Educational Assessment?
Types of Assessments Offered
Cognitive Assessment
 Cognitive assessments measure how a child learns, thinks, and processes information. They explore areas such as verbal comprehension, reasoning, visual–spatial ability, memory, and processing speed. These assessments can provide information about a child’s overall intellectual ability (IQ) and help identify strengths and challenges that may affect learning. Cognitive assessments can also be used to support diagnoses such as intellectual disability and global developmental delay, and to guide tailored support at home and school.
Psycho-Educational Assessment
 A psycho-educational assessment combines a cognitive assessment with direct testing of academic skills such as reading, writing, and mathematics. Information is also gathered from parents and teachers to understand your child’s learning in different settings. These assessments can help identify Specific Learning Disorders (such as Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, or Dysgraphia). Please note: for a psychologist to diagnose a Specific Learning Disorder, the child must have completed at least six months of targeted intervention (e.g., in literacy or numeracy) prior to assessment.
ADHD Assessment
 ADHD assessments provide a clear understanding of whether attention difficulties are impacting your child’s learning and behaviour. ADHD is a neurological condition that affects around 5% of children and can influence concentration, behaviour at home and school, friendships, and self-esteem. Children with ADHD often experience challenges in three main areas:
* Inattention – easily distracted, disorganised, wandering off task, difficulty sustaining focus

* Hyperactivity – excessive movement, fidgeting, or constant talking

* Impulsivity – interrupting, acting without thinking, difficulty waiting their turn
This process involves gathering information from parents and teachers through questionnaires and interviews, as well as observing your child during an assessment session. A psycho-educational assessment is often included to explore attention, focus, and learning skills, and to rule out any underlying learning difficulties. A comprehensive ADHD evaluation will include a Cognitive assessment (WISC-V) to measure intellectual ability and rule out other concerns (e.g. intellectual disability, learning disorders), Academic assessment (WIAT-III) to evaluate achievement in reading, writing, and maths, Behavioural rating scales (e.g. Conners-4, completed by parents and teachers) to gather information across home and school environments, as well as parent interviews and observations to better understand your child’s strengths and challenges. This process allows us to determine the ADHD presentation type (inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, or combined) and the severity of symptoms. By the end of the process, you will have an informed answer about ADHD and a detailed profile of your child’s learning and attention strengths and needs. 
Giftedness Assessment
 Giftedness assessments identify children who demonstrate advanced abilities in areas such as reasoning, problem-solving, creativity, or academic achievement. These assessments explore cognitive strengths and may also include academic testing to provide a full picture of your child’s potential. Understanding giftedness can help guide decisions about enrichment programs, school placement, and strategies to keep your child engaged and challenged. A giftedness assessment can also highlight areas where additional support may be needed, as gifted children sometimes present with unique social, emotional, or learning challenges.
Does my child need an assessment?
Sometimes it can be difficult to know whether your child’s challenges (or strengths) are part of typical development, or whether they would benefit from a formal assessment. Below are some common signs for each type of assessment we offer:
________________


Cognitive Assessment
 May be helpful if your child:
   * Struggles to keep up with learning despite trying hard

   * Has difficulty with memory, problem-solving, or following instructions

   * Works more slowly than peers
   * Late speech development 
   * Limited vocabulary growth 
   * Trouble learning basics 

   * Shows uneven development (strong in some areas, weak in others)

If this is the case your child may be suffering from global developmental delay or an intellectual disability, or other concerns such as speech and language delays.

Psycho-Educational Assessment
 May be helpful if your child:
      * Has ongoing difficulties with reading (indication of dyslexia), writing, or maths (indication of dyscalculia)
      * Appearing intelligent but has difficulty putting their thoughts on paper

      * Avoids or becomes frustrated with schoolwork

      * Makes frequent errors with spelling, reading, or number concepts

      * Shows a gap between their ability and classroom performance
      * A teacher has informed you that a psycho-educational assessment is required to assist in the development of an individualised education plan and to be able to provide increased learning support to your child.

If this is the case your child may be suffering from a specific learning disorder such as dyslexia, dyscalculia or dysgraphia, or other concerns such as poor working memory and processing speed.

How Should I Prepare My Child for an Assessment?
To ensure we get the most accurate picture of your child’s abilities, please keep the following in mind:
                                    * Make sure your child is well-rested and feeling physically well on the day.

                                    * If they take prescription medication, continue as usual.

                                    * Ensure they have had something to eat and drink beforehand, and bring along snacks and water.

                                    * If they use glasses or a hearing aid, please bring these with you.

                                    * Provide any previous medical, school, or allied health reports in advance, as these give us valuable background information.

                                    * Let us know about any sensory preferences or additional needs — we will do our best to accommodate these and make the session as comfortable as possible.

💡 Tip: Reassure your child that the assessment is not a “test to pass or fail” but a chance for us to learn more about how they think and learn so we can help them succeed.
